        <p>This campaign was designed as a submission to the 2020 Denver One Club Awards. The competition had an open brief for student work, so I worked off of the following brief: “Tabasco is known for its spicy red sauce. But Tabasco is too spicy for some. So they’ve launched a new sauce: Tabasco Sweet & Spicy. How to we get people excited about a Tabasco sauce that isn’t hot?” In response to the brief, I created a campaign to advertise the new sauce. My target audience was new customers who like a milder taste than the traditional hotness Tabasco brings, as well as existing customers who will try the new product because of their brand loyalty. The concept behind the campaign was highlighting the sweet taste notes of the new sauce by showing the sauce surrounded by traditional sweet foods. This is communicated to customers through the strong visuals and the simple line: “Same explosive flavor, now with a hint of sweetness.”</p>
