    <!-- BLOCK ELEMENTS! -->
    <!-- There are six total heading elements in HTML -->
    <h1>This is an H1</h1>
    <h2>This is an H2</h2>
    <h3>This is an H3</h3>
    <h4>This is an H4</h4>
    <h5>This is an H5</h5>
    <h6>This is an H6</h6>
    <!-- The paragraph tag actually produces larger text than the last two headings with the default styling. -->
    <p>This is a paragraph tag.</p>
    <!-- All of these elements are examples of Block Elements -->
    <!-- Block elements make blocks of content on a page. Each block element starts a new line on the webpage -->
    <!-- Other examples of Block Elements: -->
    <div></div>
    <section></section>
    <!-- Divs have no defined purpose, whereas sections come with an inherant assumption that the things in the section container will be related in some way. -->
    <!-- Fundamentally though, you can use either for the most part. You could even use a <div> to create a section -->

    <!-- INLINE ELEMENTS! -->
    <p>Here's a paragraph with an <strong>inline element!</strong></p>
    <p>Here's a paragraph with an <em>inline element!</em></p>
    <p>Here's a paragraph with an <u>inline element!</u></p>
    <p>Here's a paragraph with an <a href="google.com">inline element!</a></p>
    <!-- some examples of inline elements include: -->
    <strong></strong> <!-- OR --> <b></b> <!-- for bold type -->
    <em></em> <!-- for italic type -->
    <u></u> <!-- for underlined type -->
    <a></a> <!-- anchor tag: biggest use is for creating links on the page -->
    <!-- inline elements only impact the type that they surround. they don't make new lines -->

    <!-- INSERTING IMAGES! -->
    <img src="img/cu-logo.png" alt="CU Boulder Logo">
    <!-- remember that the image tag does not need a closing tag! -->
    <p><a href="/aboutme.html">Here's a link to another file!</a></p>
    <!-- the a tag above needs to be wrapped in paragraph tag or another block element in order for it to appear on a new line in the webpage -->

    <!-- GOOGLE PAGE REPLICATION APPROACH -->
    <!-- step 1: google "atlas institute" to pull up the page we're trying to replicate
         step 2: start building a single entry from the list of search results
         step 3: can then copy and paste that code twice more to get the two more main entries on the page
         step 4: figure out how to get the indented section - HINT: use a table! this is actually not good practice in real life, but for replicating this page with no CSS,
         its the best option.
