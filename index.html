    <h2>My name is Ashley Schoenbauer.</h2>

    <h3>My pronouns are she/her or they/them, so either set works for when you're referring to me.</h3>
    <h4>My goal for this course is to create a portfolio website that is more unique and exciting than my current one.</h4>
    <h4>I'm also excited to be able to discontinue my payments to Squarespace once I have my own site to use in the future! :D </h4>
    <p>A little about me:</p>
    <p>I am from Fort Collins, Colorado. True to the CO Native stereotype, I love being outdoors and getting into the mountains to hike and explore whenever possible.</p>
    <p>I'm in my final semester here at CU. I am a Strategic Communications - Media Design major with a minor in CTD.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I love creating and working with my hands. Some of my favorite hobbies are cooking, baking, and crafting with fiber, wood, metal, and other materials.</p>
    <p>My favorite time of day is the morning - I love opening my windows to let the sun in and enjoying the fresh and quiet moments. I start each morning with a yoga practice and a mug of coffee, which always sets me up to have a great day.</p>
