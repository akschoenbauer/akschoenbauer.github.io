    <p>The blue jay (Cyanocitta cristata) is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passerine">passerine</a> bird in the family Corvidae, native to eastern North America. It lives in most of the eastern and central United States; some eastern populations may be migratory. Resident populations are also in Newfoundland, Canada; breeding populations are found across southern Canada. It breeds in both <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deciduous">deciduous</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coniferous">coniferous forests</a>, and is common in residential areas. Its coloration is predominantly blue, with a white chest and underparts, and a blue crest; it has a black, U-shaped collar around its neck and a black border behind the crest. Males and females are similar in size and plumage, and plumage does not vary throughout the year. Four subspecies have been recognized.</p>

    <h2 id="description">Description</h2>
    <p>The blue jay measures 22-30 cm from bill to tail and weighs 70-100 g with a wingspan of 34-43 cm. There is a pronouced crest on the head, a crown of feathers, which may be raised or lowered according to the bird's mood. Its plumage is lavender-blue to mid-blue in the crest, back wings, and tail, and its face is white. The underside is off-white and the neck is collared with black which extends to the sides of the head. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remiges">wing primaries</a> and tail are strongly barred with black, sky-blue, and white. The bill, legs, and eyes are all black. Males and females are almost identical, but the male is slightly larger. The black plumage on its nape, face, and throat varies extensively between individuals; it is believed to assist in recognition between individuals.</p>

    <h2 id="distributionhabitat">Distribution and Habitat</h2>
    <p>The blue jay occurs from southern Canada (including the southern areas of provinces from Alberta eastward to Quebec and throughout the Atlantic provinces) and throughout the eastern and central United States south to Florida and northeastern Texas. The western edge of the range stops where the arid pine forest and scrub habitat of the closely related <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steller%27s_jay">Steller's jay</a> (C. stelleri) begins, generally in the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains. Recently, the range of the blue jay has extended northwestwards so that it is now a rare but regularly seen winter visitor along the northern US and southern Canadian Pacific Coast. The blue jay occupies a variety of habitats within its large range, from the pine woods of Florida to the spruce-fir forests of northern Ontario. It is less abundant in denser forests, preferring mixed woodlands with oaks and beeches. It has expertly adapted to human activity, occurring in parks and residential areas, and can adapt to wholesale <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deforestation">deforestation</a> with relative ease if human activity creates other means for the jays to get by.</p>

    <h2 id="diet">Diet</h2>
    <img src="/img/bluejaycronch.jpg" alt="A blue jay eating a peanut" width="300">
    <p>Blue jays are omnivorous, but the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audubon_Society">Audubon Society</a> estimates that 75% of their diet is vegetable matter. They have strong black bills which they use for cracking nuts, usually while holding them with their feet, and for eating corn, grains and seeds. Blue jays particularly love to eat peanuts in the shell. Its food is sought both on the ground and in trees and includes virtually all known types of plant and animal sources, such as acorns and beech mast, weed seeds, grain, fruits and other berries, peanuts, bread, meat, small invertebrates of many types, scraps in town parks, bird-table food and rarely eggs and nestlings. Blue jays will sometimes cache food, though to what extent differs widely among individuals. Although seemingly contentious in their general behavior, blue jays are frequently subservient to other medium-sized birds who visit bird-feeders. In Florida, blue jays were dominated at feeders by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_gray_squirrel">eastern gray squirrels</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_scrub-jay">Florida scrub-jays</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_grackle">common grackles</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-headed_woodpecker">red-headed woodpeckers</a>, all of which were occasionally observed to aggressively prevent the jays from feeding.</p>
